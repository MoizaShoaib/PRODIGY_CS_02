# PRODIGY_CS_02

This Python script provides a simple command-line interface to encrypt and decrypt images. You can choose between two methods for encryption and decryption:

Swap Pixels: 
This method swaps pixel values within the image. It's a basic form of encryption where pixel values are rearranged according to a predefined pattern.

Apply a Basic Mathematical Operation:
This method applies a basic mathematical operation to each pixel. For example, you can invert colors by subtracting each pixel value from 255.
